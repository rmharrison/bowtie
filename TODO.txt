Want to use seperate controllers for Fabric and Options. 
Models are taken from routes, meaning I need two routes for fabric and options?

- Make canvas application to allow user to modify bow tie shape
    Options for style/size will apply presets, that the user can then modify.
- Use fabric option to change bow tie color
- Display both the front and the back of the bow tie
- Allow user to click the front/back. This will select where the fabric and options are applied.
